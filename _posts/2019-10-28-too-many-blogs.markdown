The world does not need another blog, but I am writing it anyway. With all this noise about simple, sexy static site generators I could not resist the temptation to try it myself. Luckily for me, playing with CSS and complaining about everything are two of the things I like doing most.

I call it **Cucumber**.

The first question that naturally posed itself was the choice of static site generator/blog framework/whatever you want to call it. The [paradox of choice](https://gostrengths.com/what-is-the-paradox-of-choice/) is very much present in this domain. There are multiple products available that do more or less the same, but are all built on different technologies.

- Jekyll
- Gatsby
- NextJS
- NuxtJS
- Hugo

Can somebody tell me why we need all of these? I don't give a rat's ass whether your tool is built with Ruby or Go. The only thing I care about is how easy it is to install and set-up, which they all seem to pretty bad at. (I had to get out the ol' Ubunty VM and install Ruby + a bunch of packages to get this going).

I chose the first one, because it's the one that Github offers out of the box. I guess the others do as well, but I couldn't be bothered to look it up or try it out.

Here is a list of things that I consider myself knowledgeable about, or in which I have a special interest:

- Software development
- Integrations between IT systems
- APIs
- Training
- Human languages
- Psychology
- User experience

I work in an IT company that develops specialized software for the television industry. 

Consider this blog to be a mixed bag of complaining, knowledge sharing, writing practice and learning. (Seriously, teaching something is the best way to learn it yourself. Try it.)
